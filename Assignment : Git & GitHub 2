**1. How do you check if Git is available on your system?**  
You can check if Git is installed by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
git --version
```
This will display the installed version of Git if it is available.

**2. How do you initialize a new Git repository?**  
To initialize a new Git repository, navigate to your project folder and run:
```bash
git init
```
This creates a new `.git` directory, making your folder a Git repository.

**3. How do you tell Git about your name and email?**  
You can configure your name and email using the following commands:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
These settings apply globally for all your repositories. If you want to set them for just one repository, remove the `--global` flag.

**4. How do you add a file to the staging area?**  
To add a file to the staging area, use:
```bash
git add <filename>
```
To add all files, use:
```bash
git add .
```

**5. How do you remove a file from the staging area?**  
If you want to unstage a file (remove it from the staging area), use:
```bash
git reset <filename>
```

**6. How do you make a commit?**  
To commit your staged changes, use:
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
The commit message should describe what changes were made.

**7. How do you send your changes to a remote repository?**  
To push your commits to a remote repository, use:
```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```
Usually, you push to the `main` or `master` branch, so the command would be:
```bash
git push origin main
```

**8. What is the difference between `clone` and `pull`?**  
- **`git clone`**: This command is used to copy an entire remote repository to your local machine. It’s typically used when you want to start working on a project for the first time.
- **`git pull`**: This command is used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your current branch. It’s used to update your local repository with the latest changes.
